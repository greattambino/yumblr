## Minimum Viable Product

Can't decide what to eat? Yumblr is like a Stumble Upon for discovering what to
eat based on images of popular food items in your area (or the location you set
  it to). It is built using Ruby on Rails and React.js, and allows users to:

<!-- This is a Markdown checklist. Use it to keep track of your progress! -->

- [ ] Create an account
- [ ] Log in / Log out
- [ ] Browse through popular food items
- [ ] View details about the item such as (price, rating, location, restaurant, etc.)
- [ ] View details about the food item’s restaurant
- [ ] Filter by food category, open now, price, etc.
- [ ] Narrow/widen the search radius based on the user’s current location
- [ ] Search by city
- [ ] “Like” a food item and save it to his/her favorites list
- [ ] Utilize Google Map's API for directions to the restaurant
